## Fuel model comparisons
The comparisons between NFDRS Version 2/3 and Version 4 fuel models is presented in this workbook: [NFDRS Fuel Models](NFDRSV4-FuelModelComparisonsAndFigures.ipynb)

## Model comparison and evaluation core framework
An example model evaluation for the Lolo National Forest that uses the NFDRS4 command line interface is presented in this workbook: [Example NFDRS Eval for Lolo NF](NFDRSV4-TechDoc-RunNFDRSLoloEval.ipynb)
